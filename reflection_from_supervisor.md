# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well

It completely treated him as a colleague :-)

## What I could do better

I am unsure if I should have told that playing games on a phone while among people is not what is expected. I think it is fine to let people be themselves, where on the other hand, we all need to be told this :-/

## My conclusion about Noah

These are some things I've observed:

- He comes across as polite
- He comes across as serious
- His English is good enough to work at university
- He is able to figure out things himself
- He has his own ideas, as written down in the report
- He follows instructions well

I would recommend Noah to anyone giving a PRAO.
