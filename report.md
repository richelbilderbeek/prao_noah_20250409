I checked my theory, in which I thought a chi-squared test where each square has the same number in it, would yield a low value of independence. I thought this would be true, however I had forgotten that a high p value means a high independence with no correlation, and not a low value.
I ran a chi-squared test with men and women, and the number of cat/dogs each group had. I put a '5' for each value, and the results of this yielded a p value of 1. Since there is obviously no correlation between gender and choice of pet.
Tried to load data from teaching_hours.csv, but ran into issues.

  If a table shows a potential gendered effect, prove it is a
  significant effect
