# Reflection

The goal of a reflection is to improve.

One does so writing down how a passed day went:
what did yo do, how did it go and how can it be improved?

By forcing oneself to think of this, one can actually learn from the past.

## What did you do?

```text
Throughout the PRAO, I have written a report on statistics, and learning statistics. I started with learning about and doing some simple chi-squared tests, and then tried the main task of proving if theres an effect between teaching hours and gender at the university.
```

## What did you do well?

```text
I believe I did well on proving my conclusion that, yes, there is an effect between gender and teaching hours. I also believe my formulation and spelling throughout the report I wrote is good.
```

## What could be improved?

```text
I personally can't think of anything to improve, as I think the tasks were scaled to my knowledge levels quite well, and everything was learnable throughout the time constraints of the day. It was fun challenging myself with the tasks at hand, and the breaks spread out over the day made it very manageable.
```

## What did your supervisor do well?

```text
My supervisor explained statistics very well to me, and made sure I understood everything before moving on to the next task at hand. He's also very good and strict with time, which made it easy for me to focus on learning.
```

## How can your supervisor be improved?

```text
I don't really have many gripes with the supervisor, I think he did his job really well, and I honestly can't think of anything to improve. He explained well, asked many questions which forced me to have to use my brain a lot, and even showed me around the building on one of the breaks.
```

## What would you do differently next time?

```text
Next time I would probably try using my time a bit better, as I did look down at my phone several times while working.
```

## Which tip would you give to future PRAO students?

```text
Listen carefully to the explanations when you're given them. If you lose focus important information could be lost on you, and if you simply listen and take your time processing the info, a lot of issues can be avoided.
```
